1. Block and Inline
    Block(= Boxes)
        e.g) <main><main/> <div><div/> 
    properties they have
        1. they don't let other thing to come next to them.

    Inline
        e.g) <a><a/> <span><span/> <img/>
    properties they have
        1. The other inlines can come next.

    * Remember what is inline. *

2. Change Block and Inline in to each other(by using properties "display")
    BLock and Inline has defalt properties as "block" and "inline"
    we can chage by giving different value. 

    When we put property = "inline" in to things that use to be block, it looses width and hight. 
    * Because inline don't have does properties. *

3. Three properties of Box
    1. margin : margin is the area outside the border of the box. 
        When to boxes has the same hight, browser thinks these two margin same. Which mean's it shows the larger margin on the screen 
        even the margin values are differnt. This is called Collapsing margin.
        * This is only happens at the top & bottom. 
        i.e) 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="kr">
        <head>
            <style>
            html{
                background-color: tomato;
            }
            body{
                background-color: violet;        
                margin-top: 50px;
                margin-left: 30px;
                margin-right: 20px;
                margin-bottom: 50px;
            }
            div {
                height: 150px;
                width: 150px;
                background-color: whitesmoke;
                margin-top: 0;
            }      
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div></div>    
        </html>
        * In this code, the real looking margin-top of <div><div/> is 50px *

        in the code, you can shorten to put a margin value by the following.
        margin: (up&bottom) (right&left);
        margin: (up) (right) (bottom) (left);

        2. Padding : Area inside the border of the box
