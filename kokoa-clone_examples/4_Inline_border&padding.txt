1. Magin, border and padding of Inline. 
    In Inline, there are no height and width so the margin on the top and bottom arn't applied on the screen. 
    * So if you want to make a magin on the top and bottom of the inline, you have to change it in to block by using inline property *

2. Class 
    Class is a thing made to point several tags in once. It is made because we want to point specific tags seperatly. 
    When we use id, we have to name them differently. Eventhough we can optimize the code like # dlfdl, #ldfdl, #dldl{} 
    but when we want to give a properties one by one at the same time we have to write them seperatly anyways. 
    how to write : .classname
        also you can give several classes at one time by writing .class = "class1 class2 class3"
