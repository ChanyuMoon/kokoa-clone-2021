Q : How to put block parallel. 
    1. display: inline-block;
        This SUCKS, cus it changes by the which moniter you look. 
    2. flexbox
        display: flex;
        1. You talk to parents when you want to move children. 
        2. main axis
            justify-content asigns on the main axis
        3. cross axis
            align-items asigns on the cross axis.
            
        And for default main is horizontal(default) and cross axis is vertical(default). 
        + vh(viewpoint hight) i.e) 70vh : uses 70% of the height of the screen. 
            1. flex-direction: column ; --> this changes the main axis as column(vertical) 
                and the cross axis is axis perpandicular to main axis. 
            2. flex-wrap
                we can select the property of how to wrap.
