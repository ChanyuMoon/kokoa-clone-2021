Q : What if we want to only select the tags inside the parent tags
    1. We use combinators. In this way only condition is the fist tags should be upper then the next tags. 
    --> (more higher tag) (higher tag) tagname{
        blablabla
    }
    2. But if we only want to restrict the tags right under, we can write as the following. 
    --> parent > tag{
        blablabla
    }
    3. We can also choose the tag next to something
    --> a + target{
        blablabla
    }
    4. And in the case if we want to find the brother tag which is not diretly next, we use this quote. 
    a ~ target{
        blablabla
    }
    --> But this quote follows the Cascade. Which means it only finds brothers at the back of the standard(기준) tag.
